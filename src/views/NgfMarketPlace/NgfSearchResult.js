                  chorizo, and cook, stirring occasionally until lightly
                  browned, 6 to 8 minutes. Transfer shrimp to a large plate and

                  chorizo, and cook, stirring occasionally until lightly
                  browned, 6 to 8 minutes. Transfer shrimp to a large plate and
                  set aside, leaving chicken and chorizo in the pan. Add
                  pimentón, bay leaves, garlic, tomatoes, onion, salt and
                  pepper, and cook, stirring often until thickened and fragrant,
                  about 10 minutes. Add saffron broth and remaining 4 1/2 cups
                  chicken broth; bring to a boil.

                  Add rice and stir very gently to distribute. Top with
                  artichokes and peppers, and cook without stirring, until most
                  of the liquid is absorbed, 15 to 18 minutes. Reduce heat to
                  medium-low, add reserved shrimp and mussels, tucking them down
                  into the rice, and cook again without stirring, until mussels
                  have opened and rice is just tender, 5 to 7 minutes more.
